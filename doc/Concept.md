# Concept

This document provides a comparative analysis of three tools for deploying Kubernetes clusters in a local environment: minikube, kind, and k3d. Each of these tools has its own characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, which will be discussed below.

## Conclusions

In the context of the PoC for the AsciiArtify startup, the recommended tool for deploying a local Kubernetes cluster is k3d. It provides rapid deployment and testing of Kubernetes clusters, automation capability, and support for cluster monitoring and management. Also, bearing in mind possible problems with the Docker license for Windows and macOS, it is worth considering an alternative - Podman, which can be used with k3d to work with containers.
